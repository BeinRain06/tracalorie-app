# What I learned

### First time using webpack

i learn basic configuration with `webpack` **frontend environment**. How to use **web.confg.js** file to set parameters as :

- **loaders** (css-loader, style-loaders)
- add **plugin** to use extra features of webpack ( mini-css-extract-plugin, html-webpack-plugin)
- configure the **scripts** for the **development mode** and the **production mode**
- set **webpack live development server**

### First time using webpack

I also earn about **requestAnimationFrame** . Do you knoow that we can repaint our dom using plain javascript.
What i means by repaint our DOM is to re-render the content of our dom without using a framework.

To do that, we use this method **requestAnimationFrame** to tell the document object that be ready i will send you that **functions** that you need to execute before you **repaint** the dom.

- In our case this function is the function we called **update** : `requestAnimationFrame(update)` and we do it recursively to keep track the change of the DOM. It is why this function is called inside the earlier named function `update`.

### Mobile Responsiveness

    - Mobile reponsiveness for mobile max-width: 320px ,max-width: 626px,
