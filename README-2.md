## Description : \* challenge issue

**style javascript effect progress bar**

I was confused when made a progress bar in bootstrap will bootstrap class of `progress` or `progress-bar` how to change background color of the **progessBar**.

- I proceed doing
  ` document.getElementById(`calorie-progress`).style.background= "red"`
  for example but it didn"t work.

**a hint**

> i have to use insted `percentage` and style **width** property rather than _backgrounnd_
>
> I obtain a result doing like :
> ` document.getElementById(`calorie-progress`).style.width= `${width}`%`

above the _width_ wrap by the dollar sign represent our calculated **width** that we assign to the style. And too notice the add of `%` after that to pass effectively this value as a `percentage`.

> **Re-render the DOM with vanilla Javascript**

Well that it is a urge learn and you definitely need to know about that . Well Vanilla looks kind of super fast to achieve static App. Now if you need vanilla to react to change **user** are making to the **dom** you will have to write your javascript in **class** object because only class have this power to re-render after the actual data inside is loaded.

> But To do so, we have after instanciating our class created somewhere outside the class

- e.g : `caloriesTracker = new CaloriesTracker();`

to lead back to our **class** and called inside **re-render** method thats inside will perform some action **displaying** and this method likely nee to be **private** to the class. See:

> ` class CaloriesTracker {

constructor() {
this.\_caloriesLimit = Storage.getCaloriesLimit();
this.\_totalRhytmCalories = Storage.getTotalRhytmCalories();
this.\_meals = Storage.getMeals();
...
}

// Public Method
addMeal(meal) {
this.\_totalRhytmCalories += meal.calories;
this.\_meals.push(meal);
this.\_displayNewMeal(meal);
**this.\_render()**;
...

}

// Private Method
\_render() {
this.\_displayTotalRhytmCalories();
this.\_displayCaloriesBurned();
this.\_displayCaloriesConsumed();
this.\_displayCaloriesRemaining();
this.\_displayCaloriesProgress();
}
}`

Doing that we can for our case re-render the **stats** (caloriesConsumed, ...) that deal with the method **addMeal()**

## Javascript structure:

> - two main components `index.js`, `breakkout,js`

## css structure:

> mainly Bootstrap
> style.css file

# What I learned

### First time using webpack

i learn basic configuration with `webpack` **frontend environment**. How to use **web.confg.js** file to set parameters as :

- **loaders** (css-loader, style-loaders)
- add **plugin** to use extra features of webpack ( mini-css-extract-plugin, html-webpack-plugin)
- configure the **scripts** for the **development mode** and the **production mode**
- set **webpack live development server**

### use power of bootstrap

You cannot just googling on bootstrap everitime you want to find information about e.g implementing a new color, a modal. a progress bar, or media queries.
You can just **downlodad** file such as :

- bootstrap.css & bootstrap.css.map
- bootstrap-utilities.css & bootstrap-utilities.css.map
- bootstrap-reboot.css & bootstrap-reboot.css.map
- bootstrap-grid.css & bootstrap-grid.css.map

or whatever you just need in your project
and Include this/thes file in you `css` style folder . Then will coding , check for the necessary information on these files rather than go once again online

### Mobile Responsiveness

    - Mobile reponsiveness for mobile min-width: 210px
